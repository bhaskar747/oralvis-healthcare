## Future AI Integration

This platform is **AI-Ready**. The next logical step is to integrate a machine learning model to provide diagnostic assistance. The workflow would be:
1.  A patient uploads an image.
2.  The image is sent to a dental AI model (via an API) for analysis.
3.  The model returns suggested annotations (e.g., identifying potential caries, inflammation).
4.  These suggestions are pre-loaded in the annotation tool for the dental professional to review, modify, or approve, significantly speeding up the review process.
